1.  Introduction

   Multiple Internet standards describe common mailbox names (mailbox @
   domain) to be used by organizations for operational and business
   functions.  This document defines a new mailbox called "privacy" that
   SHOULD be used for contacting domain name owners about privacy
   issues.

2.  Mailbox Definition

   Several mailboxes are defined in section 4 of [RFC2142] that are
   intended to be used by outside parties to contact the organization
   that own the domain name about specific operational issues.  This
   document updates section 4 of [RFC2142] with an addition of a new
   mailbox that SHOULD be used to contact the domain name owner
   regarding privacy issues.  Further information regarding privacy
   issues in Internet protocols can be found in [RFC6973].

   The new mailbox is defined as follows:

      +---------+--------------------+-----------------------------+
      | MAILBOX | AREA               | USAGE                       |
      +---------+--------------------+-----------------------------+
      | PRIVACY | Customer Relations | Privacy issues and concerns |
      +---------+--------------------+-----------------------------+

   Example of a new mailbox:

   privacy@example.com

3.  Security considerations

   Organizations setting up this mailbox should be aware of potential
   for spam, malware and other attacks via emails sent to this address.

4.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions

   However, an IANA registry for common mailbox names may be a good idea
   in the future.

5.  Terminology

   In this document, the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED",
   "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY",
   and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].
